Ben, on project conception:

  

"If you're anything like me, you kind of hate SQL. It's not that I don't think it's good, but it is annoying. SQL has been what we use for database management for about 50 years and it has reigned nearly uncontested.

  

  

There's countless GUI's for interacting with your SQL database, but they all have one thing in common. They all require you to type your own queries. Now, if you're interacting with a database chances are you know what you are doing and that is not a huge deal, but developers often find themselves having to mentally change languages constantly. Remembering a language as finicky as SQL can be a real pain, especially if you are only making a minor change or check.

  

  

This project aims to create a point and click style of operation to maintaining a SQL database. This allows less experienced users to aid in maintenance in a low danger manner, as well as allows developers to carry out simple actions easily, without needing to change languages in their head."

### Project Status --

Project is phase 1 development COMPLETE! This means all core features are built out and lightly bug tested.

  

It is now entering phase 2 development. A group of testers is being selected and will use the product for some time, compiling a list of bugs to before the next phase.

  

Phase 3 development will include UI/UX improvements and branding before full release.

### Getting started --

  

  

Simply building the project will create a .exe file in the _/bin_ folder, that can be opened normally. Your first window will prompt you for database connection string information. If the connection is successful, you will see a success message and the version info of the database you have connected to. Otherwise, you will see an error message.
